If I start a new software company and i want to hire from my batch befor hiring I would like to consider the following points:

1.Since every new employee can have a huge impact on a startup company, it is important to hire people you trust.
2.A major focus in startup roles is strengthening your internal relationships (between employees) as well as external ones (between other companies and customers or clients).
Without filling these roles, your company will have no direction and lack strong leadership.
3. And not only above two I would like to consider the people who have skills and maintains a proper discipline.

so by taking the above points into consideration

The first one I would like to take 

1.Munagapati Yeshwanth - Why i would like to hire him??? Because I saw his enthusiasm to learn new things and explore new technologies and he is also a fast learner 
                         although he is weak in communication i would like to hire him since he maintains an equity among all which is one of the best quality of team
                         leader.
                        
And coming to second person

2.B.L Phani kumar - He is innocent but talented and has a great quality of listening to others before expressing his view of point and maintains time punctuality,
                    discipline etc.
