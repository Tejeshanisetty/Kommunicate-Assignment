Myself Tejesh Anisetty currently pursuing my B.Tech CSE final year in SRM ramapuram campus.I am enthusiastic to learn new technologies so in search of my interest i found
that I am interested in web development.So,i took a course from udemy The complete web development bootcamp by Angela Yu and completed the course.

After completing my course i worked on few projects namely Responsive food Website Design and TO-DO list.

          I build this project using HTML5,CSS3 and basic Java script.This project is basically an UI-UX design which consists of food products that are available to 
order and the cost of each product etc.
